Formal Readme Coming Soon
Should install like a regular package in SMF 2.0.4

[b]UPDATE:[/b]
I noticed (after finally getting some sleep) that although the mod installs correctly, the intergration functions are not added properly.  For now, after successful package installation, you'll have to upload LikesInit.php to your boardurl (where SSI.php is) and visit it one time.
